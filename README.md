# CO2 Emissions Analysis Project
- Overview : 
This project analyzes historical CO2 emissions data, their relationships with various socioeconomic factors, and provides predictive models for future emissions. The analysis includes detailed examination of emission trends, sector-wise contributions, and regional variations, along with machine learning models for emissions forecasting.
- Historical Trends Analysis : 
  - Timeline Overview : 
1850-1950: Gradual increase from 0.19M to 0.56M, reflecting early industrial revolution
1950-2000: Exponential growth reaching 1.83M, driven by post-WWII industrialization
Post-2000: Sharp decline to 0.73M, indicating potential shifts toward renewable energy

- Geographic Distribution : 
  - Top Contributors : 
United States leads with >0.6 million metric tons
Followed by China, Russia, India, and Brazil with significant gaps
Moderate contributions from Germany, UK, Canada, and Japan
Lower emissions from countries like Mozambique, Ecuador, and Finland

- Sector-wise Analysis :  Major Contributing Sectors - 

  - Land Use Change: Highest contributor (>4.5M tonnes) : 
Includes deforestation and agricultural expansion
Major impact on carbon release into atmosphere

  - Coal: Second-largest source : 
Critical role in industrial processes
Significant contribution to power generation

  - Oil: ~3M tonnes :
Transportation
Industrial applications
Energy production

  - Other Sectors :
Gas CO2 (~1.5M tonnes)
Cement production
Flaring
Other industrial activities

- Relationship Analysis :
  
  - Energy Use vs CO2 Emissions :
Strong direct correlation
Linear relationship observed
Consistent upward trend across countries
Clear clustering patterns based on energy consumption levels

  - GDP and Population vs CO2 Emissions :
Non-linear relationship with population
Scattered pattern with GDP
Complex interactions between economic growth and emissions
